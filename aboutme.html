            Hello, I am Dvsairam from India. I had completed my undergraduation in ECE Branch. 
            Now i am here to pursue my Masters in Applied Computer Science Course in 
            North West Missouri State university. I like reading Books and browing. I worked as
            a data analyst for one year and as a Govt employee for two years.

            This film has 70% of comedy, 20% of songs and 10% of action in the backdrop of 
            undercurrent love. Once, I started watching this film, I forgot about everything else
            and immersed myself in the inscrutable story that is unfolding on the screen. This film
            is an urbane one and has got all the ingredients the youth looks for. Pawan Kalyan is 
            going from strength to strength and this is the best film done by him so far. The success 
            of this film is unstoppable. But the magnitude of success of this film depends on how 
            hardcore masses embrace this delicate urban youth film. Only the time will tell.
