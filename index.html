            <p>
                It's a very nice place to <b>dine in</b>. There is park behind this restaurant where 
                we guy's make much fun all the time. And the restaurant has good place for children
                 to play. As it is very <b>hyginic place</b> we prefered to go there all the time 
                 during our free time.
